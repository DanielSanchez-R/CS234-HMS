Instructions on how to compile and execute .java source files. Note*** Make sure you have JDK installed, you will need it for javac command.
*NOTE the folder provided has already done these steps to repeat them simply delete the compiled files and repeat these steps.
*NOTE the default login screen user can be anything justy not empty and the password is enter. For the manager tab inside the program the user is: manager and the password is: enter
*NOTE the workable jar file is already functional and inside of the 'HMS_Stage4_Final' folder inside of its 'src' folder labeled 'HotelManagement.jar' delete it also if you want to compile to jar again.
Other wise enjoy!


1.) Open your respective Operating Systems terminal via the Windows 'Start key' or its equivalent on your respective Operating  System.
e.g., Linux users might use a 'Super key'.


2.) Modify (if incorrect directory/pathway) to the appropriate(address) location where you downloaded the HMS_Stage4_Final each respective, and then append the last folder within HMS_Stage_Final to access java source files. 
This folder is labeled 'src' and an exmple of this is below:
C:\UsersExample\danielExample\Desktop\HMS_Stage4_Final\src <- this is an example of navigating to the folder within the HMS_Stage4_Final to compile source files in 'src'
  

3.) Once you have the correct pathway leading to the .java source files within the terminal you can use the javac *java command to compile the source files alltogether.
e.g., javac *java


4.) After you have compiled the source files using the command javac you can then create the jar file with the terminal command: 
e.g., jar cvfm App.jar Manifest.txt *.class data.csv       
An Example of changing the programs app name to HotelManagement below instead of default:
e.g., jar cvfm HotelManagement.jar Manifest.txt *.class data.csv  

5.) Now an executable Jar file will be located in the 'src' folder you can create a shortcut to your desktop for ease of use if you want at this point.

Enjoy!
